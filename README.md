# Safe and Efficient DRL Driving Policies using Fuzzy Logic for Urban Lane Changing Scenarios

```markdown
## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the model described in the paper:
[Safe and Efficient DRL Driving Policies using Fuzzy Logic for Urban Lane Changing Scenarios](https://doi.org/10.26599/JICV.2024.9210054)
```

## Branch Selection
```markdown
Before proceeding, please switch the branch from `main` to `master`. Under the `master` branch, you will find a folder named `11`. Please download this folder before running the model.
```

## Installation and Setup
```markdown
### Steps to Run the Model
1. **Install CARLA**: Download and install the CARLA simulator from [CARLA's official website](https://carla.org/).
2. **Run CARLA**: Start the CARLA simulator successfully before running the model.
3. **Execute the Model**: Locate the file named `carla_DDPG` and run it to reproduce the results.
```

## Results
```markdown
Below are some loss curves and sample scenarios from CARLA to illustrate the model's performance:
